# Docker: Overview & Usage

## What is Docker?
Docker is a platform that allows developers to package applications and all of their dependencies into standardized units called **containers**. These containers can run consistently across different environments, whether on a developer's machine, in testing, or in production.

## Why Use Docker?
- **Consistency**: Ensures the application runs the same in any environment by packaging all dependencies.
- **Portability**: Containers can run on any system with Docker installed.
- **Isolation**: Each container is isolated, allowing multiple applications to run without conflict.
- **Efficiency**: Simplifies deployment and scales easily across systems.

This makes Docker an essential tool for modern development, enhancing both productivity and reliability.

## What is a Docker Image?

A **Docker image** is a **read-only template** that contains everything needed to run an application â€” including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

Think of it as a **blueprint** for creating Docker containers.

### ðŸ§± Key Points:
- **Immutable**: Once built, the image does not change.
- **Built from a Dockerfile**.
- Used to **create containers** (`docker run <image>`).
- Can be stored locally or in remote repositories like **Docker Hub**.

### `docker run hello-world` Command

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

### What it Does
The docker run hello-world command is a simple command used to verify that Docker is installed and working correctly on your system. When you run this command, Docker will:

- Check if the hello-world image is available locally on your machine.

- If the image is not found, Docker will automatically download (pull) the hello-world image from Docker Hub.

- Once the image is available, Docker will run it inside a container, which will print a confirmation message to the terminal, letting you know that Docker is functioning properly.

### Expected Output
When you successfully run `docker run hello-world`, you should see the following message:

```bash
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
```

### `docker run -it ubuntu bash` Command

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu bash
```

### What it Does
The docker run -it ubuntu bash command starts an interactive Ubuntu container and opens a bash shell inside it.

-it: Combines -i (interactive) and -t (terminal) to allow you to interact with the container.

ubuntu: Uses the official Ubuntu image to create the container.

bash: Starts the bash shell inside the container.

### Expected Output
After running the command, you should see:

```bash
root@<container_id>:~#
```

This indicates you're inside the container, and you can run bash commands. To exit, just type exit.

### `docker run -it python:3.9` Command

```bash
docker run -it python:3.9
```
### What it Does
The docker run -it python:3.9 command creates a new container from the official Python 3.9 Docker image and opens an interactive terminal session.

-it: Combines two options:

-i (interactive): Keeps the standard input open, allowing interaction with the container.

-t (terminal): Allocates a terminal to the container for a more readable, interactive interface.

python:3.9: Specifies the Docker image to use for creating the container. Here, python is the official Docker image for Python, and 3.9 is the specific version tag, meaning it will use Python version 3.9.

This command is often used when you want to run a Python 3.9 environment inside a container, allowing you to execute Python commands interactively.
