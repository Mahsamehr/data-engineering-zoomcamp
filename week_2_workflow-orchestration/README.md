# Workflow Orchestration with Kestra

This weekâ€™s focus is on mastering workflow orchestration using **Kestra**.

Kestra is an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform that makes it easy to build and manage both scheduled and event-based workflows. It leverages **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** principles, enabling developers and data engineers to define powerful, reliable workflows with minimal YAML.

## Why Kestra?

- **Open-source and extensible**
- **Supports both scheduled and event-driven tasks**
- **Easy-to-write YAML-based configurations**
- **Scales for modern data and process orchestration needs**
